# Metadata

This directory contains information of genomes and sequence reads on publicly available databases used in this project.

Specifically, it contains the following files:

```
|-- GTDB_sp_clusters_r202.tsv       # downladed from GTDB repository.
|-- GTDB_taxonomy_inuse.pkl.bz2     # GTDB taxonomic information of the genomes used in this project
|-- NCBI_asm_inuse.pkl.bz2          # NCBI assembly summary information for the genomes used in this project
|-- NCBI_refseq_bacteria_assembly_summary_210520.txt # downloaded from NCBI FTP server
|-- README.md                       # this file
`-- refseq_gtdbrep_mappings.pkl.bz2 # a list of GTDB representative genomes corresponding to the NCBI RefSeq genomes used in this study.
```

Due to my limited understanding of redistribution rights, I will not release these data on github at this time.
